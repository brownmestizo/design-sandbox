<p class="lead">Flash messages, or alerts, inform users of successful or pending actions.
Use them sparingly. Donâ€™t show more than one at a time.</p>

A basic alert box is just a transparently-bordered box with a <code>margin-bottom: 20px</code>
and a <code>padding: 15px</code>. Please do not overwrite these values.

```html_example
<div class="alert" role="alert">This is a basic alert box.</div>
```

Add <code>.alert-warning</code> or <code>.alert-yellow</code> to the flash message to make it yellow.

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
    Warning! Something is wrong here.
</div>
```

Add <code>.alert-success</code> or <code>.alert-green</code>  to the flash message to make it green.

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    Yes! This is to confirm you've done a great and solid job!
</div>
```

Add <code>.alert-danger</code> or <code>.alert-red</code> to the flash message to make it red.

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert">
    Oopss. That's not right, and that's bad of you.
</div>
```

###We have also created specific Concrete elements for Central.

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-pink" role="alert">
    This is a Repair work order alert
</div>
```

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-info" role="alert">
    This is a Service work order alert
</div>
```

```html_example
<div class="alert alert-orange" role="alert">
    This is an Inspection work order alert
</div>
```
