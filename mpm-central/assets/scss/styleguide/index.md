##A living style guide for CSDS Central

This design system reflects the components and patterns that underpin Central. 
This system provides a unified language and consistent feel when designing modules within Central.

At present, Concrete serves two purposes. It's a repository for common user interface 
elements and patterns across CSDS Central. It is also a *usable* tool which can be used 
and incorporated in to any project that wants to branch off from what we have done here.

##What and why
Concrete is Central's internal CSS framework.It includes basic global styling for typography, 
small components like buttons and tabs, and our general guidelines for writing HTML and CSS. 
It's currently being used in the Equipment section of Central. 

##Overview
Concrete is based on the [Bootstrap framework](http://getbootstrap.com/ Bootstrap framework) 
and the [Inspinia Responsive Admin Theme](https://wrapbootstrap.com/theme/inspinia-responsive-admin-theme-WB0R5L90S Inspinia
Responsive Admin Theme). 

##Browser support
Concrete currently supports anything apart from Internet Explorer.
